## 🍼 Project Tagline  
ECD-Coach is a multi-agent AI assistant that helps parents of toddlers understand developmental milestones, get personalized daily activity ideas, and track their child’s growth over time.

# 🧩 Problem

Parents of toddlers constantly wonder:

- “Is this behavior normal for his age?”
- “Is this drawing advanced or typical?”
- “What should we play today that actually supports his development?”

Most guidance is scattered across blogs, forums, and social media. It’s not personalized, doesn’t track progress, and often increases anxiety instead of reducing it. Parents rarely have expert support and feel overwhelmed trying to understand their child’s development.

There is a clear gap between early childhood science and everyday parenting needs.

# 🎯 Solution — ECD-Coach

**ECD-Coach** is a multi-agent AI system designed to give parents clarity, structure, and support.

The system includes four collaborating agents:

### **1. Milestone Analyst Agent**
- Analyzes a child’s behavior/drawing
- Compares it to age-appropriate milestone ranges
- Returns clear, non-diagnostic feedback

### **2. Activity Planner Agent**
- Generates personalized daily/weekly activities  
- Categorizes into fine motor, gross motor, language, pretend play  
- Uses child’s interests remembered in long-term memory  
- Uses a loop to refine the plan until it meets quality constraints

### **3. Parent Mentor Agent**
- Provides empathy, emotional support  
- Helps with worries like playground conflict or social challenges

### **4. Safety Agent**
- Wraps all outputs  
- Ensures no unsafe medical advice  
- Redirects to professional help when needed

Behind the scenes, ECD-Coach uses:
- Multi-agent workflow  
- Custom tools (structured milestone data)  
- Built-in tools  
- Session + long-term memory  
- Context compaction  
- Logging + evaluation

# 🌱 Why Agents?

A single LLM can answer questions, but it cannot:

- Maintain a consistent child profile  
- Track growth over time  
- Separate milestone evaluation from planning and safety  
- Provide structured, layered reasoning  

Agents allow the solution to behave more like a real team:  
a developmental educator + a play therapist + a parent coach + a safety reviewer.
